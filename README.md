# Assignment #0: Workshop 1 Setup!

To ensure we make the most of our time together, we will need you to install a couple things before the workshop begins:
- VSCode
- Node.js
- GitHub
- Git

If you have any issues installing these, feel free to reach out to a pod leader, ask in the `workshop-questions` Discord channel, or contact me at kevin.t.jin@vanderbilt.edu.

> The only IDE you'll ever need

VS Code is the most popular IDE out there for software development, and it's completely free! You can install different extensions to customize VS Code as you wish, and code in any language you like! You can download it at:
