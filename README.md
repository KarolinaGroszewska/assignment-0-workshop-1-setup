# Assignment #0: Workshop 1 Setup!

To ensure we make the most of our time together, we will need you to install a couple things before the workshop begins:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/signup)

If you have any issues installing these, feel free to reach out to a pod leader, ask in the `workshop-questions` Discord channel, or contact me at kevin.t.jin@vanderbilt.edu.

## Visual Studio Code
> The only IDE you'll ever need

VS Code is the most popular IDE out there for software development, and it's completely free! You can install different extensions to customize VS Code as you wish, and code in any language you like! You can download it at:

https://code.visualstudio.com

## Node.js
> Javascript's runtime environment

Node.js is a way for your computer to interpret and run the Javascript code we'll be writing. It also comes with the Node Package Manager (npm), which will allow you to import libraries such as React, Express, etc. You can download it at:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Git and GitHub
> Save and share your code

Git is a "Version Control System" that allows you to do many things such as save your code, create different versions of your code in "branches," or revert to an older version of your code. It is incredibly useful for collaboration between developers, as well as avoiding losing progress in the code we write if we make a costly mistake. 

With over 73 million developers in 2021, GitHub is the most popular way to share and collaborate on coding projects. You will need Git and GitHub in CS 3251 and onwards.

Instructions to download Git are found here:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Signing up for GitHub is simple, and can be done here:
https://github.com/signup

Linking Git and GitHub, however is not as simple.
